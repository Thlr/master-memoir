\begin{abstract} 
	The use of containerized applications in web platforms has given
	developers much more control over their resources than they had before,
	when there was no intermediate between the application and the physical
	servers. Services are now encapsulated in their own environments, and
	can be shipped on any machine without further development. Eventually,
	developers realized they could go even further by automating containers
	management operations. In this context we witnessed the rise of
	container orchestration software which gave institutions an
	unprecedented ease of administration over their services. Kubernetes is
	one such software and arguably the most popular container orchestrator
	amongst web platforms. It has also become a standard in the Deep
	Learning community as it is providing the building blocks for
	constructing the emerging field of MLOps, which is the application of
	DevOps concepts to the Machine Learning domain. However, while
	Kubernetes is now a standard solution for any institution who wishes to
	leverage container technology for its infrastructures, many fundamental
	questions remain. One such issue is the problem of scheduling, which in
	computer science is the action of allocating tasks submitted by users
	on available resources.  In order to properly evaluate and develop
	schedulers, or more broadly \textit{Resource and Jobs Management
	Systems (RJMS)}, researchers have used simulators to model complex
	networks and computing infrastructures accurately in a short amount of
	time. Indeed, the cost of running experiments on real systems will
	never be justified by the improvements these experiments would enable.
	While the default Kubernetes scheduler works well for most of the
	\textit{Cloud Native} infrastructures, \textit{High Performance
	Computing (HPC)} researchers would rather experiment with different
	batch processing policies on Kubernetes cluster as they do with
	traditional HPC. Our goal in this master thesis is to describe Batkube,
	which is an interface between Kubernetes schedulers and Batsim, a
	general purpose infrastructure simulator focused on the study of RJMS.
	Batsim itself is based on the sound and scalable models of SimGrid
	which is a popular framework for building distributed system
	simulators.

\renewcommand\abstractname{Acknowledgements}
\begin{abstract} 
	I would like to express my gratitude to Michael Mercier, my
	supervisor, and Olivier Richard who also supervised this work for their
	invaluable implication during the whole project. I sincerely thank them
	for giving me a guideline, for changing my perspective when I was going
	the wrong way, for their contribution to this work, for their sympathy
	and for their precious advices throughout these months.  I thank Adrien
	Faure for giving me a first review on my work and helping me with my
	graphs that would not be as readable and space efficient without him,
	Pedro Velho for his feedback on this report that helped me improve my
	text flow for those first paragraphs, and especially Michael Mercier for
	reviewing the whole paper. I warmly thank Milian Poquet for answering
	my interrogations whenever I had some. I also value the time I could
	spend at the LIG and I thank the DATAMOVE team for their sympathy for
	the time that I was there. Finally, my gratitude also goes to the Ryax
	team that helped me maintain human contact during the lockdown induced
	by the covid pandemic. The regular meetings we had and their positive
	feedback were essential to me under this very particular context.
